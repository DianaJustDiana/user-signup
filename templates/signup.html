The following things should trigger an error:

The user leaves any of the following fields empty: 
    username, password, verify password.
The user's username or password is not valid -- for example, 
    it contains a space character or it consists of less than 3 characters or more 
    than 20 characters (e.g., a username or password of "me" would be invalid).
The user's password and password-confirmation do not match.
The user provides an email, but it's not a valid email. Note: the email field may be 
left empty, but if there is content in it, then it must be validated. The criteria 
for a valid email address in this assignment are that it has a single @, a single ., 
contains no spaces, and is between 3 and 20 characters long.
